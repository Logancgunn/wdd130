            <p>This is my first semester here at BYU-I and I have been living in oklahoma on and off for the last 10 years, but I was born in Florida.</p>
            <p>I really enjoy going to the gym, trying to be active outside, I do play video games primarily with my dad and my brothers though.</p>
            <p>I am studying software programming and I am really excited to see what all kinds of things I will be able to do and see how I could even help advance this field beyond where it is.</p>
