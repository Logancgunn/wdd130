        I then want to be able to show her services and rough prices. To even just be able to have a button somewhere that says to get an estimate, because not all businesses are created equal. Maybe just have an estimate built in, have it be based on the type of business and size. Her main focuses are on Payroll, Bookkeeping, Quickbooks Training, Taxes, and also Notary services.
        Ideally, I would also have a place where I could have reviews, so that I can show what businesses and owners have thought of her work in the past. I would let them have the ratings also be based upon the service that they personally contracted.

      <h3>About our Founder</h3>
      <p>         
        So first thing for this website is I want to show the experience level of our main accountant, the owner of the business. She has 20+ years of experience, has worked with several businesses that all say that she has done an exceptional job. I want to point out her certificates as well as the focus on what she does, what services she provides.
        I can also have a page that specifically talks about the accountant, about her life. Make it more personal where they get to know her, talk about being the mother of 5 and what those kids are now doing. Talk about how her father is a CPA / accountant and that is kind of what got her into wanting to be an accountant as well.
