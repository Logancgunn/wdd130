        <h3>With more than 20 years of experience our founder has helped numerous people with their accounting needs. 
            It all started when she was a little girl, her father himself was also an accountant. 
            She spent several afternoons with him and learned more about accounting, and decided that it was something
            that she wanted to do as a career. She has worked for several businesses and has made a name for herself amongst
            all of those whom have had the pleasure to have her around. She decided that she wanted to help far more
            people though, and that is when she started her own business.</h3>
